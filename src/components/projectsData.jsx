        A conceptual website project for a fictional electronic music and culture festival. 
        The aim was to design a website concept that embodies the festival's atmosphere, 
        engages visitors, and inspires them to explore the event â€” ultimately leading to ticket purchases. 
        The main goal of the website is to sell tickets.

      I analysed several festival websites and identified trends and effective solutions that I could apply to the project. 
      The following features were implemented to support the project goal:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Persistent ticket purchase links in the header and footer for easy access.</li>

      The design was inspired by futuristic and urban aesthetics, using neon colors against dark backgrounds to create a "rave" feeling. 
      I wanted to evoke the essence of electronic music through vibrant neon hues and smooth, flowing graphic elements. 
      I used rounded corners and circular shapes to create more fluid and dynamic visual style reinforcing a sense of movement.

    overview: `
      <p>
        This note management app is a React project that was originally developed as a coursework assignment for a frontend course. 
        After completing the original version, I wanted to further develop the project with a more polished user interface and improved functionality. 
        NoteTaker 2.0 is an updated version of the app. 
        Throughout the development of this project, I learned a lot about state management and component usage in React. I used ChatGPT with technical problem solving.</p>

      <br>

      <p>The app is primarily designed for desktop use.</p>

      <br>

      <h4>The original requirements</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Save courses and class notes locally</li>
        <li>Fetch courses and notes from a REST API</li>
        <li>Add and delete courses and notes</li>
        <li>Create session-based notes tied to courses</li>
        <li>Restrict access to note creation if no courses exist</li>
        <li>Filter notes by course using a dropdown menu</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h4>What's new in version 2.0</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>New UI with sidebar navigation and active page highlights</li>
        <li>Improved usability with clearer instructions for users</li>
        <li>Harmonized color palette and modern design</li>
        <li>Fixed course creation ID issue: in the previous version, users had to provide the course ID when adding a new course.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      
      <p>
        The frontend is built with React.js, Mantine component library, and Zustand for state management. 
        React Router handles navigation, and the demo app is deployed on Netlify.
