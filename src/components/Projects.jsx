        A conceptual website project for a fictional electronic music and culture festival that offers live performances, cultural and artistic workshops, panel discussions, and light art installations. 
        The aim was to design a website concept that embodies the festival's atmosphere, engages visitors, 
        and inspires them to explore the event â€” ultimately leading to ticket purchases.
        The main goal of the website is to sell tickets.

        I analysed several festival websites and identified trends and effective solutions that I could apply to the project.

          <li><strong>Persistent ticket purchase links </strong> in the header and footer for easy access.</li>

        The design was inspired by futuristic and urban aesthetics, using neon colors against dark backgrounds to create a "rave" feeling. 
        I wanted to evoke the essence of electronic music through vibrant neon hues and smooth, flowing graphic elements.

        I used rounded corners and circular shapes to create more fluid and dynamic visual style reinforcing a sense of movement.

    This note management app is a React project that was originally developed as a coursework assignment for a frontend course.
    After completing the original version, I wanted to further develop the project with a more polished user interface and improved functionality.
    NoteTaker 2.0 is an updated version of the app. Throughout the development of this project, I learned a lot about state management and component usage in React. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The app is primarily designed for desktop use.
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>The original task</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Save courses and class notes locally</li>
      <li>Fetch courses and notes from a REST API</li>
      <li>Add new courses and notes</li>
      <li>Delete notes</li>
      <li>Create notes within sessions, where each session is tied to a specific course</li>
      <li>Prevent access to the note creation view if there are no courses in the system</li>
      <li>Allow users to filter and view notes for a specific course using a dropdown menu</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>What's new in version 2.0</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>New UI with sidebar navigation and active page highlights</li>
      <li>Improved usability with clearer instructions for user</li>
      <li>Harmonized color palette and modern design</li>
      <li>Fixed course creation ID issue: in the previous version, users had to provide the course ID when adding a new course</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    The frontend is built with React.js, Mantine component library, and Zustand for state management. React Router handles navigation, and the demo app is deployed on Netlify.
